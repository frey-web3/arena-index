# arena-index

**Arena Index** is a curated discovery hub that spotlights the most relevant and engaging content in the Avalanche and broader Web3 ecosystem. Rather than aggregating everything or offering real-time data, Arena Index focuses on surfacing high-quality, high-signal projects, media, and news through editorial curation and community engagement. We aim to make exploration easier by providing a trusted front page for what matters most — be it emerging dApps, innovative NFTs, or key ecosystem updates.

> ⚠️ **Note:** This project is under active development.  
> The codebase is evolving rapidly, with frequent changes, additions, and improvements. Expect regular updates as we continue refining both functionality and design.
