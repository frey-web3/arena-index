            <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those rights.

These Terms constitute the entire agreement between us regarding our Service, and supersede and replace any prior agreements we might have had between us regarding the Service.</p>
